The S2 Geometry Library is a spherical geometry library, useful for manipulating
regions on the sphere (commonly on Earth) and indexing geographic data.

See http://godoc.org/github.com/timehop/gos2/s2 for documentation.

For an analogous library in C++, see http://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library/.
